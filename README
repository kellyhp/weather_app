## General Info
This project is a react application of a weather app taken from https://openweathermap.org's API. It displays an image and search bar on the left hand side and the current forecast along with the upcoming day ahead. This weather app uses React useState for state management, react-icons for styling, moment for parsing data objects, and environment variables.

## Reflection
Some things that can be improved would be to create a smoother responsive design and fixing some bugs such as tracking live location accurately and changing padding value(not my preference). This application can also be expanded by adding an 8-day forecast or a forecast map.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
- CLion 2022.2.1 (can use any other IDE that is C++/C compatible)
- CMake (VERSION 3.15.3)
- CMAKE 14

## Setup 
To run this project, download the github zip file and open it on a code editor. Then run it on the terminal with

```
$ npm start
```
